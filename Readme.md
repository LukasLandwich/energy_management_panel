# The FZI Energy Management Panel (EMP) 

Building energy management (BEM) can be understood as the algorithmic optimization of the energy consumption patterns of buildings regarding energy efficiency and/or flexibility. However, in order to compute the optimal operational strategy, it is necessary to assess the demand of the users that must be fulfilled by the building. Such interaction between humans and the energy management system can be achieved by utilization of web based user interfaces, which is especially cost effective due to the omnipresence of computers and mobile device in modern societies. The EMP project has been designed and developed to reduce the necessary effort to implement such user interfaces. At its heart it follows a modular approach and consists of several independent components that can be combined to a user interface that matches the need of a concrete use case, which is not limited to energy management scenarios. Furthermore, it is easily possible to extend the EMP with self written components that are called apps. In order to keep such implementations as effective as possible, the EMP builds up on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework, as the latter already provides many relevant functionality for such applications.

The EMP is the outcome of the continuous research on algorithmic energy management at the FZI Research Center for Information Technology, in particular the devision Intelligent Information and Communication in Technical Systems (IIK).

## Quick start

Clone the repository. Install the required dependencies, you might want to install those into an virutalenv or a conda environment.

<span style="color:red">TODO: Add correct git url</span>

```python
git clone ...
cd energy_management_panel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Apply migrations and start the development server.

```
cd source
./manage.py makemigrions
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver
```

You can now inspect a demo UI build with the EMP framwork by opening [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
