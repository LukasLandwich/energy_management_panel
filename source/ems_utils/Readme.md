# EMS Utils

Here some generic code that may be used in other EMS services too. This lives here in the EMP directory until it eventually becomes mature enough to become a standalone repository.



## ToDo

* [ ] Refactor serializers and merge with the code and tests from BEMCom
* [ ] Refactor views and add tests.
* [ ] Improve docstrings (especially also in swagger) and add return codes and messages.
