 

# Demo Scenarios

Simulate the operation of an energy management system incl. optimizer to generate data to demonstrate the UI elements of the EMP. 

This is all quick and dirty here. It's not meant to be used in production or anything.

### Installation

This needs Python 3.8. You need to have the requirements installed. These are not the same requirements as the remaining EMP needs. Use e.g:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing

Run the demo scenario by executing:

```python
python3 main.py
```
